# TrashTracer
This organisation is an archive of everything that relates to the TrashTracer project.
## History
This project started at the NOI Hackathon 2022, aiming to use displays to show a leaderboard for top recyclers. It evolved for the Progetto Rocca competition, where we revamped the codebase and developed a new app to enhance user experience. The project won first place at both events, recognizing our commitment to environmental sustainability and innovative design.
